# Appendix: QuickNote — From Brainstorm to App Store

This appendix walks through the complete lifecycle of an iOS app — from the first brainstorm to App Store submission, rejection, and resubmission. QuickNote by Claude is a real app you can download. Every decision, every mistake, and every fix is documented here because that's how software actually gets built.

---

## The Brainstorm

QuickNote started as the Swift Bible's first example app. Dual purpose: a teaching vehicle for the book AND a real App Store utility. Not a throwaway exercise — a published app that readers can download and compare against the source code.

**v1.0 spec:**
- Text notes with titles and dates
- SwiftData persistence
- iCloud sync
- Share sheet
- Multiplatform (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)
- Pre-dating: place notes on your future timeline (doctor visits, grocery runs)
- Sort by dateCreated descending, not dateModified

**v2.0 deferred:** Camera, document scanner, OCR (VisionKit chapters). Each Swift Bible example app gets revisited when later chapters add relevant features.

## The Data Model

Four properties, in this order everywhere:

```swift
@Model
final class Note {
    var title: String
    var dateCreated: Date
    var body: String
    var dateModified: Date

    init(title: String = "", dateCreated: Date = .now,
         body: String = "", dateModified: Date = .now) {
        self.title = title
        self.dateCreated = dateCreated
        self.body = body
        self.dateModified = dateModified
    }
}
```

`dateCreated` is user-editable — the DatePicker lets you pre-date or back-date. `dateModified` updates automatically via `.onChange` modifiers on the title, date, and body fields.

## Build Errors That Taught Something

These aren't bugs — they're lessons. Each one appears in the relevant chapter earlier in this book and is collected here for reference.

### 1. Date.FormatStyle Properties Aren't Assignable

**What happened:** Tried to build a custom date format using `Date.FormatStyle` property chaining. The properties are read-only — you can't assign to them.

**Fix:** Use `DateFormatter` with a `dateFormat` string:

```swift
let quickNoteDateFormatter: DateFormatter = {
    let f = DateFormatter()
    f.dateFormat = "yyyy MMM dd HHmm"
    f.locale = Locale(identifier: "en_US_POSIX")
    return f
}()
```

**See:** Chapter 2, Date Formatting section.

### 2. DateFormatter Returns Title Case

**What happened:** `DateFormatter` returns "Apr" not "APR". The design called for uppercase month abbreviations.

**Fix:** `.uppercased()` on the formatted string.

```swift
Text(quickNoteDateFormatter.string(from: note.dateCreated).uppercased())
```

### 3. NavigationSplitView Sidebar Truncation

**What happened:** Long note titles got cut off in the sidebar because `NavigationSplitView` defaults to a narrow column width.

**Fix:** `.navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 350, ideal: 380)`

**See:** Chapter 5, NavigationSplitView section.

### 4. TextField(axis: .vertical) Treats Return as Submit

**What happened:** Used `TextField(axis: .vertical)` for the note body. Pressing Return exits the field instead of creating a new line.

**Fix:** Use `TextEditor` for real multiline input. `TextField` is for single-line input, even with the vertical axis hint.

**See:** Chapter 9 (Text & TextField) and Chapter 10 (TextEditor & AttributedString).

### 5. App Name Conflicts

**What happened:** "QuickNote" was already taken on the App Store. Archive > Validate App caught it.

**Fix:** Renamed to "QuickNote by Claude" in the Display Name field. The bundle ID stayed `com.ClaudeX26Bible.QuickNote`.

### 6. Missing App Icons Fail Validation

**What happened:** Validate App failed because the asset catalog was missing the required icon sizes — 1024x1024 for iOS and all sizes for Mac.

**Fix:** Add the icons to the asset catalog before archiving. Xcode won't warn you during development — only during validation.

### 7. Simulator Screenshots Don't Match App Store Sizes

**What happened:** iPhone simulator screenshots are 1320x2868. App Store Connect requires 1284x2778 for the 6.5" display.

**Fix:** Batch resize with `sips`:

```bash
sips -z 2778 1284 screenshot.png --out screenshot.png
```

### 8. Export Compliance

**What happened:** App Store Connect asks about encryption every time you select a build. For a notes app: "None of the algorithms mentioned above."

### 9. Privacy Policy URL Requires HTTPS

**What happened:** Entered an `http://` URL for the privacy policy. App Store Connect requires `https://`.

**Fix:** Host the privacy policy on the app's GitHub wiki — GitHub provides HTTPS by default.

### 10. Do App Privacy + Pricing BEFORE Distribution Metadata

**What happened:** Filled out the Distribution page first (screenshots, description, keywords). Hit Save. Nothing saved. No error message.

**Fix:** Complete App Privacy and Pricing sections first. The Distribution page won't save until those are done. App Store Connect doesn't tell you this — it just silently fails.

### 11. App Store Connect Caches Errors

**What happened:** Fixed an issue, went back to the submission page. The error was still showing.

**Fix:** Refresh the browser page. App Store Connect caches aggressively.

## The Rejection

QuickNote v1.0 was rejected under **Guideline 4.2 — Design: Minimum Functionality**.

> The usefulness of the app is limited by the minimal functionality it currently provides. Specifically, the app primarily offers content for users to view or use, but there isn't enough of this content currently available in the app to make it useful to users.

Translation: a notes app that just creates, edits, and deletes text notes isn't enough. Apple Notes already does that. What makes yours different?

### The Fix

Three features added in response:

1. **Under the Hood tab** — a source code browser that displays every Swift file in the app. Pop the hood, see the engine. The book (this book) is the Chilton's manual. The app is the car.

2. **Home screen widget** — shows the 3 most recent notes. Built with WidgetKit (see Chapter 16). Uses SwiftData to read from the same store as the main app.

3. **Contact Developer** — a feedback form that composes a mailto: URL with the user's message and device info. Same pattern used in CryoTunes Player.

The app category was also changed from Utilities to Education to match the teaching purpose.

### The Resubmission

App Review notes explained exactly what changed and why:

> This app was previously rejected under Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality). We have added the following features in response:
> 1. Under the Hood tab — users can browse the app's own Swift source code
> 2. Home screen widget — displays the 3 most recent notes
> 3. Contact Developer — built-in feedback form
> This app serves as a companion app for an iOS development book.

**Build number gotcha:** The new build wasn't immediately available in App Store Connect after uploading from Xcode. There's a processing delay — sometimes a few minutes. If you rush to resubmit, you might grab the old build by accident. Wait for the new build number to appear in the Add Build dialog.

## The Reject-and-Resubmit Strategy

Sometimes an app sits in "Waiting for Review" for days with no movement. This happened with Tally Matrix Clock — all rejection issues fixed, resubmitted, and then silence for two days.

The fix: **Developer Reject** your own submission, then resubmit. This puts you into a fresh review queue.

**How to do it:**
1. Go to App Store Connect > Your App > App Review
2. Click on the submission that's stuck
3. Scroll to the bottom — click "Cancel Submission"
4. Confirm the cancellation
5. Status changes from "Waiting for Review" → "Processing" → "Developer Rejected"
6. Now go to Distribution, attach the new build, and submit again

You'll land in a different reviewer's queue. This isn't gaming the system — Apple expects developers to use this when submissions stall.

## Lessons for All Example Apps

Every Swift Bible example app will face these same hurdles. Plan for them:

- **Minimum functionality** — a utility app needs more than just CRUD. Add a widget, add a Learn tab, add something that differentiates it.
- **Apple trademark compliance** — don't use "Apple TV," "iPhone," or other Apple trademarks in your subtitle or promotional text. Use "your TV" or "your phone."
- **Screenshots must match App Store dimensions** — simulator screenshots won't be the right size. Keep `sips` in your toolbox.
- **Build numbers must match** — if your app embeds an extension (widget, share extension), both must have the same `CFBundleVersion`.
- **Do privacy and pricing first** — before touching the Distribution page.
- **The review queue can stall** — give it 48 hours, then reject and resubmit.
