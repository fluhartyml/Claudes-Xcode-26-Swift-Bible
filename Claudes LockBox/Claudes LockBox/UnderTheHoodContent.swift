                The app declares a SwiftData Schema with the two persistent models (Folder + VaultItem) and a ModelConfiguration that is NOT in-memory only — the vault has to survive launches. The container is initialized once at App startup and injected into every view via .modelContainer. The fatalError on init failure is intentional: a vault app that can't open its store has nothing useful to do, so failing fast is the honest move. The window group hosts LockScreenView, not ContentView — authentication is the front door.

                LocalAuthentication's LAContext is the single authority.

The view re-locks on .background scene phase changes — leaving the app even briefly returns the vault to its locked state. No PIN is stored; the OS owns authentication entirely. That's the right design for a personal-data vault: never reinvent secrets.

ContentUnavailableView fills the empty content/detail panes when nothing's selected, which Apple's HIG calls for. seedDefaultFolders() runs on first appear and inserts Cards / Codes / Photos / Notes so the app is useful out of the box.

                The sidebar reads folders via the parent's @Query and renders each as a Label with name + item count.

The toolbar's Add Folder button flips a binding to present AddFolderView; keeping presentation state in the parent makes the sidebar a pure rendering surface.

The toolbar's add button branches on folder name: Cards opens DocumentScannerView (VisionKit four-corner scan), Photos opens PhotosPicker, everything else opens AddItemView for a manual entry. That branching is deliberate — different vault-content kinds want different capture flows; one universal "Add" button papers over real differences.
